      <p>Welcome to <strong>The First International Workshop on Computational Jobs Marketplace</strong> to be held as part of <a href="https://www.wsdm-conference.org/2022/"><strong>The 15th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM 2022)</strong></a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Date</strong>: 1:25PM – 5:00PM <strong>Mountain Standard Time</strong>, Feb 25, 2022</li>
  <li><strong>Location</strong>: Virtual</li>
</ul>

<p>Online job marketplaces such as Indeed.com, CareerBuilder and LinkedIn Inc. have been helping millions of job seekers find their next jobs and thousands of corporations as well as institutions fill their opening positions. Along with the increase of market size, there has been a lot of interesting challenges in this domain, such as the drastic increase of work from home or remote work, the imbalance between the demand and supply of the job market, the popularity of independent workers, the capability of helping job seekers on their whole job seeking journey and career development, the different objectives and behaviors of all major stakeholders in the ecosystem, e.g. job seekers, employers, recruiters and job agents, to name just a few.</p>

<p>This workshop brings academic researchers and industry practitioners together to share early research results. We focus on the state of the art advances in the computational jobs marketplace.</p>

He proudly leads Indeed’s Data Platform team, which includes 200 Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Business Intelligence Analysts, Product Managers, and Software Engineers. He’s been “helping people get jobs” at Indeed for the past six years. Previous to this, he worked on Search and Ad ranking problems at Google. He estimates that if Indeed keeps growing at its current rate, we’ll employ over 50% of the world’s workforce by 2040, just after civilization collapses because of the Year 2038 Problem. Until then, though, Donal is going to use math, science and software to help millions of people make smarter, faster and geekier employment decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Talk Title: Unsolved Mysteries in the Online Jobs Marketplace - Unique market characteristics, Open problems and Potential Solution Paths.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Talk Abstract</strong>: Online marketplaces have flourished in recent years; as people engage with ride-sharing apps, dating sites and vacation rental platforms. In this session we ask, “what’s unique about the computational labor marketplace?”. We’ll outline differentiating characteristics such as information asymmetry, signal delay, incomplete data, and risk aversion due to high stakes. In addition, macro-economic employment patterns are evolving rapidly. New perspectives are emerging on early/no retirement, remote worki, and secondary gig roles. Covid-19 has accelerated this change. These conditions provide a rich set of novel unsolved problems. We’ll introduce three fundamental challenges we encounter at Indeed, spanning (i) structural missing data patterns, (ii) measurement limitations, and (iii) machine learning model tethering. We’ll discuss partial solution paths, and challenge attendees to contribute in “helping people get jobs”.</p>
